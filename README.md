# open-file package

An Atom package that allows users to open files in their respective default
app.

1. Press *alt-w* to open the currently open file in its default application.

2. Right-click an item in the tree view (or open the context menu on an item
in the tree view) and select Open File to open the currently open file in its
default application.

3. Right-click an item in the text editor (or open the context menu
on an open editor) and select Open File to open the currently open file in
its default application.

The default keymap for this package (alt-w) conflicts with my view-in-browser
package. I will improve this later.

For references/attribution, see the licenses provided in the node packages
installed.
